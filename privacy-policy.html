        <h1>Privacy Policy - Sit-to-Stand Test</h1>
        <p class="effective-date"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 11, 2025</p>

        <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Sit-to-Stand Test</strong> mobile application (hereby referred to as "Application") created by <strong>Sanchit Aggarwal</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is provided "AS IS" and is available on Android and iOS platforms.</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>The Sit-to-Stand Test Application is designed to help users measure and track their lower limb strength through standardized five-repetition sit-to-stand tests. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

        <h2>2. Free vs. Pro Features</h2>
        <p>The Application offers both a free version and a Pro version (one-time purchase of $1.99 USD):</p>

        <h3>Free Version:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited to one test per day</li>
            <li>Displays banner and interstitial advertisements</li>
            <li>Basic test results and timing data</li>
            <li>AdMob collects device and usage data for personalized advertising</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pro Version:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlimited daily tests</li>
